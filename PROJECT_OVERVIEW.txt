                        URBAN GARDENING PLATFORM - PROJECT OVERVIEW
===============================================================================

PROJECT NAME: EVS (Environmental Sustainability) - Urban Gardening Platform
DEVELOPER: Anish
PROJECT TYPE: Web Application for Urban Gardening Management

===============================================================================
                                PROBLEM STATEMENT
===============================================================================

Urban residents who want to grow plants in limited spaces like balconies, 
rooftops, or indoors often lack easy access to practical gardening guidance 
tailored to their small-space urban environment. They face challenges in:

1. PLANT SELECTION: Choosing suitable plants for their specific urban conditions
2. GARDEN PLANNING: Planning and tracking their garden layout and progress
3. TASK MANAGEMENT: Remembering care tasks like watering, fertilizing, pruning
4. COMMUNITY CONNECTION: Connecting with local gardening community for support
5. KNOWLEDGE GAP: Lack of beginner-friendly guidance for urban gardening

This gap makes urban gardening confusing and discouraging for beginners, 
preventing them from enjoying the benefits of growing their own plants.

===============================================================================
